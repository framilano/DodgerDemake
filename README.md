# DodgerDemake

<p align="center">
  <em>
The year is 1982 and pacman has once again managed to be zapped 
back inside a home computer. His only chance of escape from the
evil bad guy - the one that appears in all arcade games - is to 
eat his way through multiple levels of mayhem thus thwarting the 
sinister plot to take over the world. This may sound a simple task but there are four mean laser machines 
just waiting to blast pacman's hide into oblivion. It is going to take all of pacman's skill, cunning and judgement to 
dodge the laser fire and to eventually reach his goal of early 
retirement (no more pacman games please - Pacman)

## What is this?
A tribute to a Windows 3.1 game called [Dodger (1994)](https://archive.org/details/Dodger_1020#) made by Ivan Mackintosh, this is a demake though, the game is feature complete but presents a smaller playable area (128x128, due to PICO-8 features)

## Content
The game currently has only 5 levels, the original Dodger had 10 levels in its shareware version, I never found the complete version.
