The year is 1982 and pacman has once again managed to be zapped 
back inside a home computer. His only chance of escape from the
evil bad guy - the one that appears in all arcade games - is to 
eat his way through multiple levels of mayhem thus thwarting the 
sinister plot to take over the world. This may sound a simple task but there are four mean laser machines 
just waiting to blast pacman's hide into oblivion. It is going to take all of pacman's skill, cunning and judgement to 
dodge the laser fire and to eventually reach his goal of early 
retirement (no more pacman games please - Pacman)

## What is this?
A tribute to a Windows 3.1 game called [Dodger (1994)](https://archive.org/details/Dodger_1020#) made by Ivan Mackintosh, this is a demake though, the game is feature complete but presents a smaller playable area than the original one (a 128x128 grid, due to PICO-8 features).\
\
**The game is publicly available and playable on lexaoffle pico-8 site** [here](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=141398)

## Content
The game currently has 10 levels, they resemble as much as possible the OG Dodger design from the registered version of the game (not the shareware one)

## How to play
- Use arrow keys to move around.
- (On PC) Use Z/X to interact with the game.
- Eat all fruits.
- Avoid skulls and enemy ships' bullets.
- (On title screen) Press X (on PC) to change the color palette to a warmer one.
